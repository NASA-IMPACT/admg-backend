DC3 had a single deployment over the majority of the continental US, with operations over Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama, during May and June of 2012.  Three airborne platforms collected in situ and remote sensing observations that included: specific gas and chemical concentrations, cloud and precipitation particle microphysical properties, and temperature and water vapor content profiles.  Ground-based observation sites included scanning radars and launched balloons.  DC3 was funded through NASA’s Tropospheric Composition Program.',\n",

The two major goals of DC3 were 1.) quantify and characterize the convective transport of emissions and water to the upper troposphere within the first few hours of active convection, investigating storm dynamics and physics, lightning and its production of nitrogen oxides, cloud hydrometeor effects on scavenging of species, surface emission variability, and chemistry in the anvil, and2) quantify the changes in chemistry and composition in the upper troposphere after active convection, focusing on 12–48 h after convection and the seasonal transition of the chemical composition of the UT.   Salina, Kansas is the base location for the three research aircraft and the project operations center at the Salina Airport, while a network of ground-based radar, lightning antenna stations and instrumentation in Colorado, Oklahoma and Alabama is used to support DC3 during the project from 15 May - 30 June 2012.',\n",

The OLYMPEX campaign utilized a wide variety of ground instrumentation, mobile radars, and airborne instrumentation to monitor the storm systems as they approached and traversed the Olympic Mountains.  The OLYMPEX campaign was part of the development, evaluation, and improvement of GPM remote sensing precipitation algorithms. Airborne observations included multiple instruments on the NASA DC-8 and ER-2, as well as cloud probes on the UND Citation.
